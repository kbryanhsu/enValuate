# enValuate
This program is not intended to be used for any diagnostic applications. Refer to physical data whenever possible.

## BEFORE YOU BEGIN:
-Make sure that you have a working version of MATLAB
-Change the filepath in the EnergyLevelModel.m file to point to wherever the lanthanide data folder is on your machine

## Running the program
Command line command is possible, but deprecated. The primary method of interfacing will be through the GUI. Run the gui_v1 file from your MATLAB window, and adjust the settings in the window.
Output spectra will appear on the graph. Peak values are relative and not necessarily a reflection of real-world observed spectra.
Use caution and restart often. Not stable

## Future Improvements:
As of right now, the effects are accurately modeled, but lacking in precision.
Further improvements will be regarding readibility of code, deobfuscation and more realistic representation of various physical effects in the nanoparticle, including phonon losses and realistic peak-falloff.
